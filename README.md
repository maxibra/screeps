## TBD:
* Create the better way to search source to harvest
    * choose free source and don't change it
    * if all sources are busy:
        * find source with more points to harvest
        * try to predict when the source will be free by how match energy a nearest harvesters are need
* Create system based on memory to save path from each requested point.
* Improve Transfers (choose a new target if remained energy. Currently choose spawn)
* Transfers. possibility to change percent of transfers if not enought creeps for more then hour
* Improve change role. currently if in the same ticket several creeps are needed to change role we have a wrong proportion
